# Purpose

As a project/organization, we are committed to creating a healthy and safe environment for all contributors, regardless of characteristics such as (but not limited to) gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or experience level.

## Expectations and Standards

### Positive Examples (Things that are encouraged):

- Using welcoming and inclusive language, this can include:
	- Using gender-neutral pronouns when you are unsure of someone's preferred pronouns. (Such as using "they" to refer to the player)
	- Don't assume that everyone has the same level of experience as you, so avoid saying things like "This is easy" or uses of "simply", "just", or "obviously".
- Offering constructive criticism such as "I think this could be improved by..." rader than "This is bad."
- Refer to others respectfully, this can include using their preferred name and pronouns.
- Staying professional and on-topic in discussions

### Negative Examples (Things to avoid):
- Being rude, disrespectful, or otherwise unwelcoming (ex: "Your code sucks!")
- Actions that would be considered unprofessional (something you wouldn't tell your co-workers or boss)


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within the project's spaces such as:
- Issues
- Pull Requests

The Code of Conduct DOES NOT apply to:

# Takeaways

Overall, we want to create a healthy and professional environment for all contributors.
Here are some guidelines to help follow the Code of Conduct without even thinking about it:
- Take notes from the Golden Rule: Treat others how you would like to be treated.
- Keep it professional: Try to keep discussions on-topic, technical, and logical especially around heated topics. We don't need to be hearing rude comments alongside your code fixes!
- Keep in mind how others may interpret your words: Remember that text can be interpreted in many ways, so try to be clear and concise in your communication.
