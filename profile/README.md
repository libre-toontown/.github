# An open source continuation of Disney's Toontown Online, based on https://github.com/open-toontown

## Goals

- Ease of use, a cross platform, server agnostic, installer/launcher for the toontown client.
- Quality of life, accessibility, and inclusivity improvements.
- Maintaining compatibility and performance with modern systems.
- Removing or replacing proprietary, trademarked, or copyrighted assets where possible.
- Optional features, such as new content, toggleable per each server.

## About

I first saw the open-toontown project and was exited to contribute, but I was disappointed to see that it acted as more of a technologically-modern archive rather than a continuation.
(Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just not what I was looking for. Also thanks for the great work!)
Most of the things I wanted to contribute were not in the scope of the project, so I decided to fork it and make my own project.
Right now I am looking to just get the project functional, and then I will start adding some of the things I wanted to contribute as well as some things that are welcome to be upstreamed (like an upcomming installer/launcher).
Do these goals seem too ambitious?
Well (hopefully) if you shoot for the moon, you'll at least break the atmosphere.
